## Shopping list application

Simple application which lets user to add, edit or delete products and then create shopping lists from these products.

I created this project to practise Laravel functionality, especially Laravel Jobs and Redis cache, because process of adding products to shopping list is handled by Jobs and result of that operation is stored in Redis cache.
